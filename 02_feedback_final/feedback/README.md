Rules for the Instructor

- Any solution must have a final line of code (non-comment, non-empty)
which simply has the name of the object representing the objectively
correct answer. This is required for both "students" and "instructors"

- Student solutions must general an object with the exact same name,
although other code (perhaps for checking or explortions) will be
ignored.

- Think carefully about how to handle set.seed(x)

- Create rules for "read.csv('')" problems. Without paths?

- Temporary moved out of R code because of checking problems.
